# Über Yatzy

Creating a browser-based scorecard for über yatzy.
Lot's of ideas, we shall see what comes out if anything.

## About the game

Played usually heads up, both players will have 5 yatzy sheets in front of them.
The game is being played normally (I assume that the rules of yatzy are known) but there are rules on how to fill the scorecard.

First lane is filled with first cast of the dice. It can only be filled after the initial toss.

The second lane can be filled not later than after the second throw.

Third lane is played like the usual game of yatzy.

Fourth lane is the usual yatzy but must be filled from top to bottom (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, pair, 2 pair, ...).

Final row is the lucky strike row. You get to throw fourth time if you missed the previous ones.

Total sum matters. Players may also agree to compare single lanes as well as the total score.
